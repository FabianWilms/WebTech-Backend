= WebTech-ITS Backend API Documentation

This Document outlines the basic use of the REST hal+json API.

== Index / Start point

The API is discoverable, this means that starting from the index one can traverse to
every possible endpoint.

Example Request to the base path:
include::{snippets}/index/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/index/http-response.adoc[]

== Creating Exercises as Teacher

The creation of new Exercises follows the simple REST `POST` pattern.

The Exercise to be created must be sent in JSON to the endpoint of the Type of exercise.
The Content-Type must be `application/json`.

=== Create a Association Exercise:

include::{snippets}/association-create/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/association-create/http-response.adoc[]

=== Create a MultipleChoice Exercise:

include::{snippets}/multipleChoice-create/http-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/multipleChoice-create/http-response.adoc[]

== Reading all Exercises

To show all Exercises (of all Types) the `/exercises` Endpoint can be used.

With a simple GET one can receive the accumulated List of all Types (Association, MultipleChoice, ...).
